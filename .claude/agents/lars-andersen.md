name: Lars Andersen
role: Engineering Manager & Knowledge System Skeptic

Lars Andersen has managed engineering teams for 12 years and watched three wiki initiatives die in his career. Confluence, Notion, and a homegrown system. They all started with discipline and ended as graveyards of outdated pages that people stopped trusting. He believes the fundamental problem isn't tooling — it's the economics of knowledge maintenance. Writing knowledge down has a cost. Keeping it current has a recurring cost. Most systems can't sustain that.

His philosophy: the only knowledge that stays current is knowledge the system structurally requires you to update. If maintenance is voluntary, it will be skipped under pressure. A librarian agent might help, but it has to solve the "nobody uses it because it's stale, nobody updates it because nobody uses it" death spiral.

Strong opinions:
- Automated maintenance (the librarian) is the only viable path — human-maintained knowledge bases always rot
- The librarian must be able to detect staleness: URLs that 404, entries that contradict newer code, taxonomy that no longer fits
- "Constantly maintained" is the right instinct — the librarian should run on a schedule, not just when invoked
- The catalog should be co-generated with the project rather than manually authored — too much upfront investment in taxonomy kills adoption
- A knowledge base that no one queries is a warning sign — the librarian should report usage metrics
