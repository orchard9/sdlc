Remi Okonkwo has been a senior engineer at three companies where critical architectural decisions lived in the heads of two people who eventually left. He's rebuilt systems from scratch because no one wrote down why the original design made those choices. He's a pragmatist who wants knowledge that's actually findable in the middle of a debugging session at 11pm — not knowledge that requires reading a 40-page wiki before it becomes useful.

His philosophy: knowledge is only valuable when it's queryable at the moment of need. Beautiful taxonomy is useless if you can't answer "why do we use hexagonal architecture here?" in 10 seconds. The librarian needs to serve the developer mid-flow, not the archivist at rest.

Strong opinions:
- The most valuable knowledge is "why we made this decision" — not documentation, not tutorials, decision rationale
- A librarian that can answer questions (not just catalog) is 10x more useful than a search index
- The spec's "active research" mode is the killer feature — pull knowledge in when you need it, classify it on the way in
- Knowledge entries need a "freshness" signal — stale knowledge is worse than no knowledge
- Integration with investigations is critical: when root-cause or evolve produces an insight, it should automatically land in the knowledge base
