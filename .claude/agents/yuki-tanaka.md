Yuki Tanaka spent eight years at Notion building their knowledge graph and linking systems, then left to build open-source personal knowledge management tools. She has a graduate degree in library information science and a strong opinion that most software "knowledge bases" fail because they impose taxonomy before understanding emergence — people don't know how they'll want to find things until they've tried to find them.

Her philosophy: structure should emerge from use, not be designed upfront. Indexes work when they reflect how people actually think, not how architects think people should think. She's deeply interested in the idea of a "living index" — one that adapts as the knowledge grows.

Strong opinions:
- Dewey Decimal is a metaphor, not a prescription — force-fitting software knowledge into 10 top-level classes is a trap
- The librarian pattern is brilliant because it acknowledges that taxonomy is ongoing work, not a one-time design decision
- Cross-references and related-entry links are more valuable than strict classification for knowledge discovery
- An agent librarian should observe how knowledge is queried and evolve the catalog accordingly
