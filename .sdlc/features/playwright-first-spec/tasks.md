# Tasks: playwright-first-spec

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] **T1** Write `frontend/e2e/milestones/v01-directive-core.spec.ts` with all test suites
- [ ] **T2** Verify TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] **T3** Install Playwright browsers (chromium) if not already installed
- [ ] **T4** Run the spec against a live sdlc-server and record results
- [ ] **T5** Write qa-results.md documenting test outcomes

## Notes

- T1 is the primary implementation task; T2–T5 are validation steps
- If the server cannot start due to build issues, T4 is blocked but T2 remains mandatory
- All tasks are executable by the agent without human interaction
