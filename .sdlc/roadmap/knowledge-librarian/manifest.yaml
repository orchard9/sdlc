orientation:
  current: Core design decided — librarian is a project-generated agent with two modes (maintain + query) and a harvest hook that forces maintenance on investigation completion
  next: 'Refine the spec: add librarian to the knowledge base spec, define the librarian init flow and the harvest hook protocol in detail'
  commit: When the updated spec covers librarian init, harvest hooks, query mode CLI, and updated entry data model — ready to commit to a feature
